            <h2> AND WHEN YOU ORDER IT, YOU SAVE THE DAY, TOO.</h2>
            <p> Pizza has a way of making a hero out of any one of us. 
                Really. Is there anyone bigger than the person who walks into the room with a pizza in their arms?</p>

We do everything that we can to make them feel good, seen, and appreciated. Then we send them back out into the world with a satisfied stomach and spirit.</p>
